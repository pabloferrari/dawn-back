    <h1 class="title">Why Baby Hands Talk?</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>Here's something amazing: your baby understands far more than they can say. Between 6 and 8 months, babies develop a strong desire to communicate—they want to tell you what they need, what they see, and how they feel. But here's the challenge: the complex motor skills needed for speech don't fully develop until around 18 months, and clear verbal communication often doesn't come until age 2 or 3.</p>
    
    <p>This creates a "communication gap"—a period where your baby has so much to say but no way to say it. That's where Baby Hands Talk comes in.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>Baby Hands Talk bridges this gap.</strong> Using simple hand gestures, your little one can tell you they're hungry, tired, want more, or even that they love you—months before they can speak these words.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="benefits-grid">
    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">😌</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Reduces Frustration</div>
      <p>When babies can express their needs—whether it's pain, hunger, or wanting a specific toy—tantrums and crying decrease dramatically. You'll spend less time guessing and more time connecting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">🧠</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Boosts Brain Development</div>
      <p>When your baby signs, they're activating multiple brain areas simultaneously—visual, auditory, and motor. This creates stronger neural connections and enhances overall cognitive development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">❤️</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Deepens Your Bond</div>
      <p>Two-way communication creates a powerful emotional connection. When your baby asks to play ball and you understand, both of you feel seen, heard, and connected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">🗣️</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Accelerates Speech</div>
      <p>Signing babies don't speak later—they often speak earlier and with larger vocabularies. The signs serve as a bridge to verbal language, not a replacement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">💪</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Builds Confidence</div>
      <p>Being understood gives babies a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. They become active participants in family life rather than passive observers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit">
      <div class="benefit-icon">🎭</div>
      <div class="benefit-title">Supports Emotional Growth</div>
      <p>Signs help babies identify and express emotions like happy, sad, or scared. This early emotional vocabulary is the foundation for healthy self-regulation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="research-note">
    <strong>📚 Research shows:</strong> Studies found that babies who signed were speaking like children 4 months ahead by age 2, and nearly a full year ahead by age 3. At age 8, these children scored an average of 12 points higher on IQ tests than their non-signing peers.
