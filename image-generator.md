MILK

A clear, simple, 2-panel step-by-step illustration showing how to sign "milk" in baby sign language (based on American Sign Language). The illustration should focus only on the hand and a small portion of the wrist or forearm, with no full person shown. The same hand must appear in both panels, identical in skin tone, proportions, line style, and angle. Panel 1: show the hand with fingers extended upward, palm facing inward toward the signer, in the starting position of the sign. Panel 2: show the exact same hand in the same orientation and position, but now with the fingers closed into a gentle fist as if squeezing, representing the end or repeated motion of the sign. Use a simple cartoon-style illustration with smooth rounded lines, minimal detail. Hand gesture should be clearly shown and centered in each panel. Pastel colors, educational style, clean and friendly. White background, no additional objects or decorations.

ALL DONE

A clear, simple, 2-panel step-by-step illustration showing how to sign "all done" (or "finished") in baby sign language (based on American Sign Language). The illustration should focus only on the hands and a small portion of the wrists or forearms, with no full person shown. The same pair of hands must appear in both panels, identical in skin tone, proportions, line style, and angle.

Panel 1: show both hands in front of the body area, palms facing inward toward the signer (toward each other or slightly toward the viewer), fingers relaxed and slightly spread, in the starting position of the sign.

Panel 2: show the exact same hands in the same general area, but now with the palms turned outward, facing away from the signer (toward the viewer), representing the end position of the “all done” sign. The change in palm orientation should be very clear, as if the hands have rotated outward from Panel 1 to Panel 2.

Use a simple cartoon-style illustration with smooth rounded lines, minimal detail. Hand gestures should be clearly shown and centered in each panel. Pastel colors, educational style, clean and friendly. White background, no additional objects or decorations.
