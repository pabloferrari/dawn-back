## 1. MUST-DO CHANGES (High Priority)

### 1.1. Distinctive Name / System Branding

- [ ] Decide on a system name (brand-like, similar to “Baby Steps” for Ramsey).

**Recommended options:**
- Simple Start Money System
- 12-Month Money Reset
- Beginner Money Reset System

- [ ] Apply chosen name consistently in:
  - **Cover (front):**
    - Line 1: `2026 Budget Planner for Beginners`
    - Line 2 (system name): e.g. `Simple Start Money System`
    - Line 3 (subtitle): `A 12-Month Guide to Track Income, Pay Off Debt & Build Savings`
  - **Interior title page:**
    - Repeat title + system name + subtitle.
  - **Intro section (“This planner is for you if…” page or next):**
    - Add a 1–2 sentence description of the system:

      > The Simple Start Money System is a 12-month, pen-and-paper plan created for total beginners. No spreadsheets, no complex formulas – just clear pages that guide you step by step to track your money, pay off debt, and build savings.

### 1.2. Unify Monthly Expense Trackers (One Clear Format)

Current issue:
- Some months show strange table structures in extraction (`| | S |` etc.).
- Inconsistent layouts can confuse users.

Decision:
- [ ] Choose **ONE standard expense tracker layout** for ALL months.

**Suggested table:**

- Columns:
  - Date
  - Category
  - Description
  - Amount
  - Payment Method
  - Notes

Example layout:

| Date | Category | Description | Amount | Payment Method | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|-------|
|      |          |             | $      |                |       |
|      |          |             | $      |                |       |
|      |          |             | $      |                |       |

- [ ] Replace all monthly “Expense Tracker” pages with this uniform template.
- [ ] Double-check spacing and line height so it’s easy to write by hand.

### 1.3. Fix Minor Table/Text Glitches

- [ ] April expenses: ensure "Healthcare" row has all columns (Planned / Actual) correctly aligned.
- [ ] December "Food & Groceries" row: add missing values/columns if needed.
- [ ] Remove any leftover letters or placeholder symbols (like repeated “S”) that may come from template artifacts.

## 2. HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (Strongly Recommended)

### 2.1. Add a “Quick Start” / “First 7 Days” Page

Goal: Reduce overwhelm and give a concrete first step for beginners.

**Placement:**
- Right after the cover or after “This planner is for you if…”.

**Suggested title:**
- `Your First 7 Days with the Simple Start Money System`

**Suggested text:**

> Feeling nervous or overwhelmed? That’s completely normal. This planner is designed for real life – no perfection required. Follow these simple steps in your first 7 days:

**Checklist (content):**

1. **Complete Your Financial Starting Point (Day 1–2)**
   - Fill out your Monthly Income, Fixed Expenses, and Net Worth Snapshot.
   - This is your baseline – no judgment, just information.

2. **Set Your 3 Financial Goals for 2026 (Day 2–3)**
   - Choose 1–3 goals that really matter to you (debt payoff, emergency fund, vacation, etc.).
   - Write why each goal is important – this will keep you motivated.

3. **Choose Your Debt Payoff Strategy (Day 3–4)**
   - Read the mini guide on Snowball vs Avalanche.
   - Select the method that fits your personality and circle your choice.

4. **Calculate Your Basic Budget (Day 4–5)**
   - Use the 50/30/20 mini guide as a starting point.
   - Fill in the “Planned” column for your first month.

5. **Schedule Your Weekly Money Date (Day 5)**
   - Pick one recurring day and time each week (for example: Sunday evening).
   - Add a reminder in your phone calendar.

6. **Audit Your Subscriptions (Day 6)**
   - Use the “Subscriptions & Fixed Payments” page to list everything.
   - Check what you can cancel or downgrade.

7. **Write Your Intention for 2026 (Day 7)**
   - At the bottom of this page, complete this sentence:
     > In 2026, I want my money to help me __________________.

### 2.2. Enhance Monthly Reflection Prompts (Behavior Change)

Current structure:
- What I did well
- Where I overspent
- What I'll change next month

Improvement:
- [ ] Add 1–2 short, coaching-style prompts for each month.

**Suggested additions:**

Below the existing reflection table, add:

- `One small win I’m proud of this month:`
  (Example: “Paid all bills on time” or “Cooked at home 3 more times than last month.”)

- `One habit I’ll focus on next month:`
  (Example: “Checking my bank app twice a week” or “Writing down every card purchase.”)

This reinforces progress and habit-building, not just numbers.

### 2.3. Add a Final “Your 2027 Money Plan” Page

Goal: Make the end of the planner feel like a bridge into the next year.

Placement:
- After “Lessons from 2026” and “2026 Year-End Totals”.

**Suggested title:**
- `Your 2027 Money Plan (In One Page)`

**Suggested layout (sections):**

- `Net worth goal for end of 2027: $________`
- `Debt payoff goal for 2027: $________ or Debt(s) to eliminate: __________________`
- `Savings goal for 2027: $________ (Emergency fund, home, car, etc.)`

- `3 money habits I want to KEEP in 2027:`
  1. __________________________________
  2. __________________________________
  3. __________________________________

- `3 money habits I want to CHANGE or DROP in 2027:`
  1. __________________________________
  2. __________________________________
  3. __________________________________

- Short encouragement line at bottom:

  > Remember: you don’t need a perfect year to make progress. You just need to keep showing up, one month at a time.

### 2.4. Strengthen the “For Beginners” Messaging

- [ ] Add 1–2 sentences in the intro reinforcing that:
  - No prior knowledge is required.
  - This is a judgment-free tool.

**Suggested text to insert on the “This planner is for you if…” or intro page:**

> If you’ve ever felt embarrassed or stressed about money, you are not alone. This planner was created for real people with real lives – no spreadsheets, no shame. You don’t have to know anything about budgeting to start. Just follow the pages and take it one month at a time.

## 3. OPTIONAL MINOR ENHANCEMENTS (Nice-to-Haves)

### 3.1. Micro-Tips for Each Month

- [ ] You already have monthly tips (e.g. “Spring cleaning? Apply it to your finances too.”).
- [ ] Optionally, refine them slightly to tie directly to behavior:

Examples:
- January: “Review post-holiday spending and choose ONE category to cut back this month.”
- February: “Perfect time to cancel unused subscriptions – give yourself an instant raise.”
- June: “Summer activities add up. Set a simple weekly fun budget and stick to it.”
- November: “Before shopping sales, write your list and total budget on this page.”

### 3.2. Slight Visual Enhancements (Without Redesigning Everything)

- [ ] Use consistent heading hierarchy for all months:
  - “My 3 Priorities This Month”
  - “One expense I’ll reduce”
  - “INCOME” and “EXPENSES” in the same style.
- [ ] Add small icons to reinforce sections (optional, only if it doesn’t clutter):
  - A small target icon next to “My 3 Priorities This Month”.
  - A small scissors icon next to “One expense I’ll reduce”.

### 3.3. Add a Short “How to Use the Savings Goals Page” Note

On the Savings Goals page, add a small instruction box:

> How to use this page:
> - Pick 1–3 savings goals that truly matter to you.
> - Break the total into monthly amounts and write them in “Monthly Needed.”
> - Each time you add money to this goal, shade in one segment of the progress bar.
> - Re-read “Why this matters to me” when you feel tempted to give up.

This helps beginners turn the graphic into an actual habit.

### 3.4. Optional: Add a Very Short “FAQ” Box

At the end of the mini guide “How to Budget” or “How to Use This Planner”, you can add a small FAQ:

**FAQ (Optional):**

- *What if my income changes?*
  Update the “Planned” numbers when your income changes and adjust your spending for the rest of the month. Flexibility is part of the process.

- *What if I miss a week or a month?*
  Don’t quit. Just turn to the current month, write what’s happening now, and keep going. Progress beats perfection.

- *What if my net worth is very negative?*
  Many people start there. The important thing is that you’re paying attention and making a plan.
