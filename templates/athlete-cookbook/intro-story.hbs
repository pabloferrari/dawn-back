        <div class="subtitle">My Story</div>
        <h1 class="main-title">Why I Wrote This Book</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="story">
        <p>I've always been overweight. For as long as I can remember. And I was never particularly good at sports—mediocre at best. But there was something I noticed early on: I had endurance. More than most people around me. That got me thinking that maybe running, a sport where you don't compete against others but against yourself, could be my thing.</p>

        <p>It wasn't. I wasn't fast. But I was consistent. And that's how it started—first just as a way to "do something." Then I joined a running group at my gym, and things clicked. I started with 10K races, and while my training partners, all 4 to 8 years younger than me, would fade, I'd arrive at the halfway point with more left in the tank, allowing me to push harder at the end.</p>

        <p>I kept going. Two or three times a week—intervals, hill repeats, recovery runs. Then came the 15Ks, and eventually, I signed up for my first half marathon. I did well. My personal benchmark became finishing under 2 hours. I thought it was nothing special, until I learned that time puts you above average among amateur runners. That motivated me even more.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
          "Everything I've found online is about elite athletes with privileged bodies competing for medals. All I wanted was to cross the finish line. To be a little better than my previous self."
        </div>

        <p>Then came the pandemic. A month before a race, everything stopped. I abandoned training completely. A year passed, several extra kilos accumulated, and when I returned, my times hovered around 1:50-1:55. I lost motivation.</p>

        <p>So I went back to functional training at the gym, three times a week, just to "do something." Then motivation returned when I saw my city was hosting a half marathon with 25,000 participants. I signed up with no proper training—no long runs, no intervals. Just functional workouts. The result? I beat my personal best by two minutes: <span class="highlight">1:47</span>.</p>

        <p>Something clicked. Suddenly I wanted to run a full marathon—something I'd never considered because I didn't think I was mentally prepared, and I expected to get bored running for 4 hours. But what I felt that day was different. I needed to take on the challenge.</p>

        <p>I went all in: functional training plus running classes. It was going well, but I had no energy. Still overweight, I couldn't even raise my arms properly. That's when I found a sports nutritionist. Over three months, we tried everything. My body wasn't responding like other athletes he worked with. Trial and error, trial and error, until we found exactly what I needed: a plan adapted to my body, my tendency to gain weight, with just the right amount of fuel to not feel exhausted all the time.</p>

        <p>It was a success. In the following months, I lost body fat and gained muscle. I was leaner, faster, stronger—mentally and physically. Everything improved.</p>

        <p>That's why I wrote this book. I know the vast majority of amateur athletes are or have been like me. If sharing my experience and discoveries helps even a few of them, my work is more than justified. In the following pages, you'll find the plans I developed, the adjustments I made along the way, and the recipes that fuel my training. The main thing is that <span class="emphasis">each person must try and listen to their own body</span>.</p>
